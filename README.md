# Sentiment analysis

Script should analyze given sentences & provide the calculated sentiment value for each,
& then store in an excel file.

The initial data to be analyzed (sentences) are to be read from an excel file.

```ml - Copy.xlsx```

then the results should be like in the file,

```xl_file_scored.xls```


# Current working script
```sentiment_intensity.py```

```emotions.txt``` & ```read.txt``` are not used in above script.

### no any model is being trained manually, thus using SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from NLTK package.
